# onion.press Configuration
# This file is automatically copied to ~/.onion.press/config on first run

# Vanity Onion Address Prefix
# Default: "op2" (generates addresses like op2xxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion)
#
# You can customize this to any lowercase alphanumeric string.
# Note: Only base32 characters allowed (a-z, 2-7). Numbers 0, 1, 8, 9 are not valid.
# Longer prefixes take exponentially longer to generate:
# - 2 chars (op): < 1 second
# - 3 chars (op2): < 1 second
# - 4 chars (op24): 5-30 seconds
# - 5 chars (op2024): 10-30 minutes
# - 6+ chars: hours to days
#
# To use a custom prefix:
# 1. Stop onion.press
# 2. Edit this file: ~/.onion.press/config
# 3. Delete ~/.onion.press/vanity-keys directory
# 4. Delete the tor-keys volume: docker volume rm onionpress-tor-keys
# 5. Restart onion.press (will generate new vanity address)
#
VANITY_PREFIX=op2

# Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer Plugin
# Default: "yes" (automatically installs and activates the plugin)
#
# The Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer plugin helps combat link rot by:
# - Automatically scanning your posts for outbound links
# - Creating archived versions in the Wayback Machine
# - Redirecting to archived versions when links break
# - Archiving your own posts on every update
#
# Set to "no" to disable automatic installation of this plugin.

# Update Docker Images on Launch
# Default: "no" (manual updates only via Check for Updates menu)
#
# When enabled, onion.press will automatically check for and download updated
# WordPress, MariaDB, and Tor container images when the app launches.
# This ensures you have the latest security patches and features.
#
# Set to "yes" to enable automatic updates on launch.
# Note: Updates only occur when containers are stopped.
