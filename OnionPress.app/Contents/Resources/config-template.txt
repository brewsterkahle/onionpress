# onionpress Configuration
# This file is automatically copied to ~/.onionpress/config on first run

# Vanity Onion Address Prefix
# Default: "op2" (generates addresses like op2xxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion)
#
# You can customize this to any lowercase alphanumeric string.
# Note: Only base32 characters allowed (a-z, 2-7). Numbers 0, 1, 8, 9 are not valid.
# Longer prefixes take exponentially longer to generate:
# - 2 chars (op): < 1 second
# - 3 chars (op2): < 1 second
# - 4 chars (op24): 5-30 seconds
# - 5 chars (op2024): 10-30 minutes
# - 6+ chars: hours to days
#
# To use a custom prefix:
# 1. Stop onionpress
# 2. Edit this file: ~/.onionpress/config
# 3. Delete ~/.onionpress/vanity-keys directory
# 4. Delete the tor-keys volume: docker volume rm onionpress-tor-keys
# 5. Restart onionpress (will generate new vanity address)
#
VANITY_PREFIX=op2

# Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer Plugin
# Default: "yes" (automatically installs and activates the plugin)
#
# The Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer plugin helps combat link rot by:
# - Automatically scanning your posts for outbound links
# - Creating archived versions in the Wayback Machine
# - Redirecting to archived versions when links break
# - Archiving your own posts on every update
#
# Set to "no" to disable automatic installation of this plugin.

# Prevent Mac Sleep While Running (AC Power Only)
# Default: "yes" (keeps Mac awake when plugged in)
#
# When enabled, OnionPress will prevent your Mac from sleeping while the
# WordPress + Tor service is running AND you're plugged into AC power.
# This ensures your .onion site remains accessible 24/7 when connected to power.
#
# IMPORTANT: On battery power, your Mac will sleep normally to preserve battery.
# Your site will go offline when running on battery and Mac sleeps.
#
# Uses the built-in 'caffeinate' command with -s flag (AC power only).

#
# Set to "no" to allow your Mac to sleep even when plugged in.
