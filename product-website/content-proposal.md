### 5. ABOUT PAGE

**Title**: About Onion.Press

**Mission**:

Remember the early web? When anyone could make a homepage? When the internet was weird and wonderful and *yours*?

That spirit lives on in the dark web.

Onion.Press brings the magic of self-hosted websites to everyone. No coding. No servers to rent. No tech company watching your every move.

Just you, your Mac, and your corner of the internet.

**Why Tor?**

The dark web isn't just for criminals. It's for:
- 🗣️ **Free speech** - Publish without government censorship
- 🔒 **Privacy** - No tracking, no data collection
- 🌍 **Access** - Reach people behind firewalls
- ✨ **Creativity** - Build weird, wonderful things

**Why WordPress?**

WordPress powers 40% of the web. It's:
- Familiar to millions
- Easy for beginners
- Powerful for experts
- Extensible with plugins

**The Story**:

Onion.Press was created at the Internet Archive as an experiment: What if everyone could run their own Tor hidden service as easily as installing an app?

The dark web shouldn't require technical expertise. Publishing online shouldn't require trusting a corporation with your data.

So we built Onion.Press.

**Open Source**:

The entire project is open source (MIT license). Every line of code is on GitHub. We believe in:
- Transparency
- Community
- Freedom
- Privacy

**Credits**:

Built with:
- WordPress
- Tor
- Docker/Colima
- Python
- Love for the weird web

Created at Internet Archive.
